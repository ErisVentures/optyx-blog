Optyx is designed to work directly alongside your editing software by staying in permanent sync with your photo's metadata on disk. When you set a rating or color label in Optyx the file's metadata is updated immediately and when you set a rating or color label in another program the metadata is visible in Optyx immediately too.

Some programs like Lightroom handle metadata differently though and sometimes conflicts can occur. This guide walks through the optimal workflow to minimize conflicts and maximize your time saved.

## Workflow

1. Import and cull photos in Optyx (See [Getting Started](/tutorials/getting-started)).
1. Select in Optyx the photos you wish to edit.
1. Drag and drop the photos into Lightroom.
1. Edit in Lightroom.

## Resolving Conflicts

If you need to go back to culling Optyx after importing into Lightroom, you won't see changes reflected immediately there. Instead you'll see a small icon in the top right corner of the photo cell that there are metadata conflicts.

This is expected and no reason for concern. Click the icon that appeared and select "Import Settings from Disk" in the popup to import the metadata changes made by Optyx.

Alternatively, select your photos with outdated metadata and select "Metadata" > "Read Metadata from File" in the menu bar to update many photos at once.
