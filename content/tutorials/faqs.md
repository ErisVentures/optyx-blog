## I'm getting a warning on Windows that Optyx is potentially dangerous on download. What's up with that?

Rest assured Optyx is safe to use, but because we're so cutting-edge, our application signature hasn't received enough volume to be whitelisted by Microsoft yet. Thanks to users like you our increasing popularity should make this warning disappear in time.

## Does Optyx work with Lightroom?

Yes! Any rating or color label assigned by Optyx will appear when imported in Lightroom. Checkout our [Working with Lightroom guide](/tutorials/working-with-lightroom/) for more details.

## Does Optyx support RAW format XYZ?

Yes! (Probably). Optyx works with a wide array of RAW formats from tons of camera models and coverage can be even further expanded by installing Adobe's free DNG converter. Checkout our [Working in RAW guide](/tutorials/working-in-raw/) for more details.

## Does Optyx automatically edit my photos too?

Not yet ;)

For now, Optyx is a tool strictly for [photo culling](https://fstoppers.com/education/beginners-guide-culling-and-why-we-do-it-89324) designed to be used in conjunction with another editor like Lightroom. Fstoppers explains it nicely...

> The process of culling is used in every type of photography and is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Culling is simply the process of selecting the best images from a shoot to be edited and delivered to a client.

Our recommended workflow is to cull all your photos in Optyx before importing to another editor like Lightroom or Luminar. Checkout our [Learning Optyx guide](/tutorials/learning-optyx/) for more details.
