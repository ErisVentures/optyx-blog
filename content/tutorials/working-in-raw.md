**NOTE**: This guide is intended for photographers who primarily shoot in RAW formats. If you aren't familiar with RAW formats or mostly shoot in JPEG, feel free to skip this.

## Overview

When working with RAW files, Optyx handles its own parsing and primarily works on the JPEG preview for optimal speed. While the most common camera models are supported natively, some just released and rarer models will require processing with [Adobe's DNG Converter](https://supportdownloads.adobe.com/detail.jsp?ftpID=6809).
