We're very excited to announce the release of Optyx `v1.5` and new accuracy improvements to help users like you!

### Improved Sharpness Labels

Optyx v1.3 brought you our beta of face focus detection, and we've continued to iterate on your feedback! Sharpness labels are now considerably more accurate. Thanks to your help we've seen accuracy rates climb from ~80% to over 95% according to our human label testers! Expect accuracy to continue to improve in novel and difficult lighting situations in future releases.
