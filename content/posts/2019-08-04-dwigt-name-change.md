**Automatic updates for the Dwigt beta application will stop with 0.0.1-beta.20. To continue receiving automatic updates you'll need to download the [new Optyx application](https://us-central1-dwigt-api.cloudfunctions.net/download).**

While the Dwigt name has served us well and been a source of more than a few laughs, it's difficult running a real product with a name that gets autocorrected by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and most major smartphone keyboards. Optyx moves our brand closer to photography and brings that fresh, misspelled, Silicon Valley vibe every startup wants.

As always, thank you for beta testing, and here's to the bright future ahead!
