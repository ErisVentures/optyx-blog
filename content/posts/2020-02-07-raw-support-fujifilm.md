We're very excited to announce native support for more RAW formats!

- Fujifilm .raf
- Olympus .orf
- Panasonic .rw2
- Canon .cr3

Importing and analyzing RAW images from these models should now be _significantly_ faster and skip the need for [Adobe's DNG Converter](https://supportdownloads.adobe.com/detail.jsp?ftpID=6809).

Let us know what you think and happy culling!
