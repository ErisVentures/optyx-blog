We're very excited to announce the release of Optyx `v1.6` and support for an even wider range of devices!

### M1 Support

Apple released their latest lineup of Macbooks at the end of 2020 with custom Apple-built processors known as the M1 chip. Older versions of Optyx used advanced instructions that these processors didn't support, but the engineering team worked dilligently to construct a compatibility layer to enable this so quickly.

### Microsoft SmartScreen Improvements

Optyx downloads on Windows should no longer trigger Microsoft SmartScreen filtering warnings thanks to extended verification and a renewed partnership with our parent company. If you see any further anti-virus or malware alerts for Optyx, please let our team know at [support@optyx.app](mailto:support@optyx.app).

Let us know what you think and happy culling!
