### Microsoft SmartScreen Improvements

Optyx downloads on Windows should no longer trigger Microsoft SmartScreen filtering warnings thanks to extended verification and a renewed partnership with our parent company. If you see any further anti-virus or malware alerts for Optyx, please let our team know at [support@optyx.app](mailto:support@optyx.app).

Let us know what you think and happy culling!
