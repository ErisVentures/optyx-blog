We're very excited to announce the release of Optyx `v1.4` and new usability improvements to help users like you!

### Guided Walkthrough

Optyx will now automatically walk new users through workflows and what makes Optyx so special. For veteran users, the new walkthrough can be accessed at any time through the `Help > Start Walkthrough` menu option.

### Improved Sharpness Labels

Optyx v1.3 brought you our beta of face focus detection, and we've continued to iterate on your feedback! Sharpness labels now have an updated AI model that will continue to improve over the next several releases.
