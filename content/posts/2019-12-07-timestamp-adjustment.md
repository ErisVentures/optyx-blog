We're excited to announce a new feature for Optyx, timestamp adjustment! We've all been there. You get on location after a long day of travel, shoot like the wind, and then realize you forgot to adjust your camera's timezone setting so all your photos timestamps are wrong, doh! ðŸ¤¦

Adjusting timestamps in Optyx is now super easy! Simply select the photos you'd like to adjust, and select "Set Taken At..." in the right-click or Photos toplevel menu. A dialog will appear to adjust your timestamp settings before confirming.

Both relative and absolute timestamp adjustments are supported for maximum flexibility. Let us know what you think and happy culling!
