Welcome to the party, Canon! On Tuesday, Canon <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/20200107-Soul/20200107-Soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the upcoming release of a Lightroom plugin for AI-based photo culling. Sound familiar? ðŸ˜‰ Here at Optyx we're firm believers that this shift represents the future of our industry and will allow photographers to spend more time using their creative juices, shooting more, and culling less. We're very pleased to see the level of investment by major corporations in this exciting area of photography and spent the last 12 months hard at work preparing for this moment.

So Canon, we say bring it on!
