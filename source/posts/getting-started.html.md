Welcome to Optyx, we're glad you're here! With our tool, you'll be culling your photos at lightning speed in no time.Optyx is built with advanced AI to streamline the culling process and remove repetitive work. The culling workflow in Optyx is built around the concept of photo groups and looks something like this...

1. Use Autogroup to group photos based on content similarity.
1. Refine groups with manual overrides.
1. Use Autocull to assign rating and color labels to the best photos in each group.
1. Scan filtered photos for stragglers and adjust metadata with manual overrides.
1. Re-import photos with set metadata to your editor.

## Autogroup

Autogroup creates photo groups based on content similarity with limits based on the time difference. Autogroup can also automatically identify bracketed shots for HDR or exposure stacking. You can control the aggressiveness of each of these options with the autogroup sliders.

1. Content Similarity - Controls grouping by content similarity of the photographs. At its strictest, photos will need to be nearly identical. At its most lenient, photos only need to have similar overall color patterns and structure.
1. Time - Controls what photos are _allowed_ to be grouped together. Photos will only be grouped together based on content similarity if the difference between their timestamps is at least this close.
1. Exposure Brackets - Controls grouping of multiple exposures. Photos will be grouped together based on exposure compensation information in Auto modes and overall exposure settings in Manual shooting modes.
